# Revision memo

Dear Editors of Political Research Quarterly,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to revise my manuscript "Intergroup Bias in Parliamentary Rule Enforcement" (Manuscript ID PRQ-2015-0341). I greatly appreciate the time and effort taken by yourself and the four reviewers to review the manuscript. The comments and suggestions by yourself and the reviewers have been extremely helpful and I have made my best effort to accommodate the suggestions in the revised version of the manuscript. I believe the changes have made for a stronger, clearer, and more persuasive paper.

Below I address the specific comments made by each of the reviewers in turn. These sections are labeled 1.1 for R1's first comment, 1.2 for R1's second comment, and so on.

## Reviewer 1

### 1.1: Data to justify 'as if' randomness

graph showing that chairperson time is allocated proportionally to seats (explain why this is not the case)

### 1.2: Abrupt conclusion

Add in discussion about all of these things:

What does it imply about how legislative rules and institutions are formed?

What are plausible things that might mitigate this bias?

Does the answer to the question depend on the mechanism? If so, how?

### 1.3: Minor points

'modal' in footnote 1

section 5.2 seems unnecessary

## Reviewer 2

### 2.1: Data to justify 'as if' randomness

Concern that chairmen self-select into issues for which co-partisans speak longer

FH: this is a pretty clever idea! need to show empirically

need to somehow show that the content of the debate is the same for copartisan and non-copartisan

### 2.2: Debate-specific fixed effects

would allow for holding issue constant (FH: not really)

### 2.3: More information about speaking assignment rules

add in some stuff from forretningsordenen

do chairmen call on more people from his/her own party? add discussion about this

### 2.4: Discuss the odd shape of Figure 2

I really don't know how to handle this

## Reviewer 3

### 3.1: Partisanship as a 'soft' test

explain why minimal groups wouldn't just be better

discuss this some more, hard relative to other tests, partisanship is not the same as in the US

### 3.2: Pattern of queues of brief remarks

look into this, not sure what he mechanism

### 3.3: Cancelling out of co-partisanship effect in the aggregate

argue softly against this

### 3.4: Generalizability

discuss theory-based vs sampling-based generalizability

### 3.5: Requirements of Social Identity Theory

don't know where he gets this stuff

### 3.6: Part 5 vs. Social Identity Theory

uhm, yeah, and that's what I'm saying

### 3.7: Intergroup bias vs. bias

what does that even mean

### 3.8: Reporting model significance

you got it dude

### 3.9: Significance of 'prime minister' variable

explain it here

## Reviewer 4

### 4.1: Interpretation

two possibilities:

1. MP's self-select into the debate schedule
2. MP's self-select into longer speaking times

R4 says (2) does not imply unequal enforcement. discuss.

### 4.2: Unexploited information  

is bias consistent across parties? coefficient masks a lot of heterogeneity

this is cool, I should just do this
