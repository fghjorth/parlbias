# Revision memo

Dear Editors of Political Research Quarterly,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to revise my manuscript "Intergroup Bias in Parliamentary Rule Enforcement" (Manuscript ID PRQ-2015-0341). I greatly appreciate the time and effort taken by yourself and the four reviewers to review the manuscript. The comments and suggestions by yourself and the reviewers have been extremely helpful and I have made my best effort to accommodate the suggestions in the revised version of the manuscript. I believe the changes have made for a stronger, clearer, and more persuasive paper.

Below I address the specific comments made by each of the reviewers in turn. These sections are labeled 1.1 for R1's first comment, 1.2 for R1's second comment, and so on.

In response to several of the reviewers' comments, I have added new figures and tables to the manuscript, some in the main text, some in the appendix. For ease of reading, I reproduce these tables and figures below, along with other material only shown in this note.

## Reviewer 1

### 1.1: Data to justify 'as if' randomness

R1 requests more empirical data in support of the claim that assignment of chairpersons to debates is "as if" random. Specifically, R1 asks for a graph showing the percentage of seats controlled by the chairperson on the x-axis and the percentage of times chairing a debate on the y-axis, noting that the points in such a graph should fall along a 45 degree line.

I thank R1 for this suggestion. However, I do not believe the predicted pattern would constitute evidence in support of "as if" random assignment. The reason for this is that members of the leadership (with some exceptions for the head chairperson) are treated equally, with no consideration given to their party's share of seats in parliament. Hence, a chairperson from the 5th largest party has the same obligations as the chairperson from the largest party (again, with some exceptions for the head chairperson). Seat share should thus not be a predictor of chairperson activity. I want to stress that the manuscript was not sufficiently clear on this point, and I have added a paragraph on p. XXX making this point more explicitly.

As additional evidence for the "as if" random assignment of chairpersons to debates, I have added section A.1, "Predicting chairman activity", to the appendix. Here I present results from regression models predicting how many debates chairpersons control. The key result from these models is that the main predictor of number of debates controlled is how long a chairperson has been a member of the leadership. There is an additional small premium for being the head chairperson, which likely reflects the fact that by convention, the president always takes the first shift controlling a debate. In contrast, number of seats has no significant association. The results are shown below.

The results complement the qualitative evidence from correspondence with the parliament leadership that chairperson activity is largely driven by 'supply-side' factors, i.e. chairpersons' availability on the day of the debate, and not by party specific factors such as their parliamentary power.

### 1.2: Abrupt conclusion

R1 notes that the conclusion is abrupt and should include more discussion of the implications of the finding.

I have extended the conclusion section with more discussion of the findings's implications. For the specific wording of the discussion, I refer to the manuscript. In short, I argue that the findings imply that intergroup bias can occur even in institutional and cultural settings that should work strongly against bias (the same reasons for which I argue the setting is a 'least likely' case). At the same time, the observed effect is fairly small, suggesting that the aforementioned factors do go some way towards mitigating bias. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, they illustrate the importance of balancing institutions. As added to the discussion in section 5.2, the effects on speaking time for each chairperson roughly wash out within each debate due to the rotation of chairpersons. This does not nullify the finding per se, but illustrates how the principle of rotating chairperson roles can result in (approximate) equity in the aggregate even in the presence of bias at the individual level (see also the discussion in section 3.3 below). I think this added discussion has strenghtened the manuscript, and I thank R1 for the suggestion.

<!-- What does it imply about how legislative rules and institutions are formed?

What are plausible things that might mitigate this bias?

Does the answer to the question depend on the mechanism? If so, how? -->

### 1.3: Minor points

Lastly, R1 mentions some minor points. I have fixed the word in footnote 1 to 'modal', as was indeed intended. R1 also notes that section 5.2 seems unnecessary, which I agree with in principle. However, section 5.2, which discusses the magnitude of the effect, speaks to a criticism sometimes raised against the finding: namely, that the observed effect is fairly small. This is indeed the case, and in section 5.2, I make an effort to be explicit about this point. Hence, I have opted to keep section 5.2, though I agree that it could be omitted if need be.

## Reviewer 2

### 2.1: Data to justify 'as if' randomness

R2 also suggests additional evidence justifying the assumption of "as if" randomness. Specifically, R2 expresses concern that chairmen might self-select into particular issues of high importance to the party. If party members also take more time discussing these issues, this self-selection would produce a spurious finding of own-group bias. As a way of countering this concern, R2 suggests showing that the issues debated are similar in copartisan and non-copartisan matches.

This is indeed a relevant concern, and I thank R2 for pointing it out. [HVORFOR MAN IKKE KAN MÃ…LE INDHOLD]

However, two aspects of how debates are organized indicate that issue-based self-selection is not likely. First of all, opening or closing debates are not about any one issue, but cover a multitude of issues, mostly based on issue disagreements between parties. MP's may debate one issue for a few remarks, and then shift to another issue. Second of all, the schedule of which chairmen oversee the debate is set in advance of the debate. Hence, chairmen are not able to opt in to the role when a particular issue comes up in the debate. The combination of these two aspects suggests self-selection based on issues is unlikely. I have added a paragraph in section 3.1 of the manuscript making this point explicitly.

For additional evidence in favor of the "as if" randomness assumption, see section 1.1 above.

### 2.2: Debate-specific fixed effects

As additional evidence in favor of the "as if" randomness assumption, R2 suggests employing debate-specific fixed effects. As mentioned, each debate covers several issues, so debate fixed effects should not be interpreted as holding issue content constant. Nevertheless, debate-specific fixed effects is a valuable robustness check of the results. Table 7 in section A.2 in the appendix shows the main results with debate-specific fixed effects added in every specification. The results are robust to including debate-specific fixed effects. The table is also shown below.

### 2.3: More information about speaking assignment rules

TJEK OM DEBATSYSTEMET ER ELEKTRONISK

add in some stuff from forretningsordenen

do chairmen call on more people from his/her own party? add discussion about this

### 2.4: Discuss the odd shape of Figure 2

I really don't know how to handle this

The pattern suggests some of the difference reflects self-censorship.

## Reviewer 3

### 3.1: Partisanship as a 'soft' test

explain why minimal groups wouldn't just be better

discuss this some more, hard relative to other tests, partisanship is not the same as in the US

in the realm of partisan identities, this test is relatively hard

### 3.2: Pattern of queues of brief remarks

look into this, not sure what he mechanism

### 3.3: Cancelling out of co-partisanship effect in the aggregate

argue softly against this

### 3.4: Generalizability

discuss theory-based vs sampling-based generalizability

### 3.5: Requirements of Social Identity Theory

don't know where he gets this stuff

### 3.6: Part 5 vs. Social Identity Theory

uhm, yeah, and that's what I'm saying

### 3.7: Intergroup bias vs. bias

what does that even mean

### 3.8: Reporting model significance

you got it dude

### 3.9: Significance of 'prime minister' variable

explain it here

## Reviewer 4

### 4.1: Interpretation

two possibilities:

1. MP's self-select into the debate schedule
2. MP's self-select into longer speaking times

R4 says (2) does not imply unequal enforcement. discuss.

### 4.2: Unexploited information about effect heterogeneity

is bias consistent across parties? coefficient masks a lot of heterogeneity

this is cool, I should just do this
