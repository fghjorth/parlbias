In this paper the authors look at whether MPs in the Danish parliament give fellow members more time to speak during the debates.  They find that co-partisans are given nearly 5 percent more time despite strict rules that keep this from happening.

I like the paper a lot.  I think that the authors do a good job convincing us that they have identified a case where we would be least likely to find the bias.  Given that we find this level of bias in such a setting is a strong indicator of the level of bias we might expect in other settings.  I also appreciate that the paper is short and to the point.  I think the authors should get a lot of credit for focusing on the contribution without providing needless ancillary information.  I think that there a few minor ways that the paper can be improved, but with those additions, I would support publication.

First, the authors rely on the assumption that assignment of the chairperson can be considered “as if” random.  It would be nice to have them provide some more empirical data so that we can evaluate that claim.  At the very least I would like to see a graph that gave on the x-axis the percentage of seats in parliament controlled by the chairperson and on the y-axis the percentage of times they were chairing a co-partisan’s speech.  Ideally you should get something that looks like a 45 degree line.  Ideally that information could be combined with other information in order to bolster the key assumption of the design.

Second, the conclusion is abrupt.  While I like short papers, I think the authors can improve the impact of the paper if they can discuss more of the implications of the finding. What does this imply by how legislative institutions and rules are formed?  What are plausible things that might mitigate the bias? Does the answer to that question depend on the mechanism?  If so, how?  I think that exploring these questions, would be a way to increase the impact of the paper.

Small points:
1) In footnote 1, I think the authors intended to write “modal”, not “model”.
2) Section 5.2 seems unnecessary.

The authors document evidence of own-group bias on the part of the chairman during parliamentary debates in Denmark. The data they use is incredibly clever in which they use the time stamps within the transcript of the debate to measure how much time each participant in the debate speaks for. They find that speeches are about 2.8 seconds longer and 5% more likely to go over the 60-second limit when the speaker and chairman are from the same political party. The setting is interesting since there are clear rules about time limits, the behavior is easy to observe and this is a society with low levels of corruption and a strong tradition of parliamentary cooperation.

Comments:

[1] One thing that I think would be really important to show evidence of is the quasi-random assignment of the combination of speaker and chairman. My main concern was that there might be issues that are of particular importance to certain political parties. If this is true, then individuals from that party might try harder to be the chairmen when those issues are being debated. These might also be the same issues for which individuals from that party will naturally speak longer leading to a spurious own-group bias.

I believe that what you are finding is in-fact own-group but I also think the alternative explanation above is reasonable. It would be great to provide some more information about how some quantifiable characteristics of the issue or debate differ based on the party of the chairmen (this will show that chairmen appear to be randomly assigned across debates). You can also do this same comparison at the speech level and show that the characteristics of the debate are similar for the co-partisan and non-copartisan observations.

[2] One approach that might help allay this concern is to employ debate-specific fixed effects. You note on page 6 that the debate lasts for 12 to 16 hours and can include 600-800 brief remarks. Given the length of the debate, there are likely to be changes in the chairmen during the course of the debate. This would allow you to hold the issue at stake constant and see if the own-group bias persists net of this control.

This would also provide an additional test of own-group bias to see if speakers from a particular party within a specific debate are more likely to speak when there is a co-partisan match with the chairman. To this point, it would also be helpful to provide a little more information about the rules about how the chairmen is to decide who gets to speak in what order. It seems that another way the chairman can allocate more speaking time to his/her own party is to just call on more people from that party. I was surprised that there wasn’t really a discussion or test of this form of bias.

[3] The other thing that is really puzzling is in Figure 2 where the distribution for the non-copartisan speech durations has such an odd looking pattern. It looks like it has an initial peak right around 40 seconds and then another one just past the time limit. I think that you make some arguments for why it has this shape in the text but this is not what I would have expected if there was just some average bias occurring by judges. In that case, we should see a larger distribution just before the cutoff and a missing chunk of the distribution just after.

The pattern that you observe in Figure 2 reinforces my concern from point 1. The fact that there is so much mass at a time so far before the cutoff (40 seconds) would be consistent with the non-co-partisan matches occurring on issues for which certain parties have less interest.

The manuscript investigates the impact that co-partisanship between the speakers and the chair in the Danish Parliament has on the chair’s likelihood of ending the 60 seconds long “brief remark” by the members of the parliament a little late.  The paper interprets the small and, in some analyses, negligibly small time differences to shared “social identity” in the sense Tajfel and Turner developed the term. I do not recommend the publication of this manuscript in PRQ for the reasons explained below.

Unfortunately, the paper does not empirically show that the small co-partisan differences are due to social identity processes. There is some discussion about a rational choice perspective and identity processes, but there is no analysis shedding light on this distinction. But for some reason authors continue to attribute the reason to social identity.

The paper is claiming that the results are the outcome of a natural experiment or that the results are obtained via a hard test of the impact of social identity in the Danish political context. Both are questionable. Partisanship of members of parliament is a very “soft” test for social identity, a “minimal group” would be a hard test. Parties for MPs are not minimal groups. Regarding the claim about natural experiments, the fact that certain talks –most probably on not bi-partisan but polarizing issues- leads to a queue of brief remarks point to another impact not accounted for. Chairs are not randomly assigned to brief remarks, the nature of the initial talk generates the brief remarks.

Also, even the very small impact of co-partisanship is cancelled out because all chairs from different parties behave similarly. So, the article isn’t even substantively interesting. This is at best a case study of the Danish Parliament. But the manuscript is claiming that results are generalizable because the perfectly functioning rule based internal workings of the Danish Parliament and the Danish political context somehow make the partisanship of MPs less salient. This is not what generalizability means.

p.4 social identity theory does not require or predict an “honest” wish to behave in line with rules. Speaking of external validity, I am not clear how the results obtained here in the Danish political context could be generalized to other parliaments.

Part 5 is not compatible with the social identity perspective or cannot be explained by it.

Conclusion section says that the manuscript shows intergroup bias. It doesn’t, it shows only bias.

Please report model significance in Table 2 and elsewhere.

This paper uses data on the duration of remarks by members of the Danish parliament and demonstrates a correlation between speech duration and the copartisanship of the speaker and the presiding officer. In the most immediate sense, the authors interpret this as evidence that “debates are not enforced equally.” More generally, the authors conclude that this is suggestive of intergroup bias, and that the finding is further strengthened by the fact that it exists in an environment in which the stakes are relatively trivial.

This is a nice little paper, and with a few (important) revisions should find a home in PRQ. It is clear and succinct. I am convinced that the assignment of the presiding officer from the set of senior members from the five biggest parties is idiosyncratic; accordingly, I am reasonably convinced that the effect the authors demonstrate is real. I am less convinced about the interpretation, and hope that the authors take the opportunity to do more to convince me (and future readers) that what he is really documenting can and should be interpreted as evidence of bias. I also think there is unexploited information in the data that the authors could use to address auxiliary hypotheses of potential interest to readers, and bolster the findings.

1. Interpretation. It seems to me that the authors provide no evidence that the presiding officers are gaveling non co-partisan speakers at the 60 second mark, but letting co-partisans (or ideologically proximate legislators) drone on for additional 2.8 seconds. So there are two possibilities here: the first is that MPs, for some reason, anticipate greater deference from copartisan presiding officers, and schedule *their* speeches to coincide with those presiding officers. Alternatively, perhaps those MPs want senior members of their own parties to hear particularly pressing points they have to make. The point is that while the timing of presiding officers may be effectively random, the scheduling of individual speeches need not be – so the match between MP making a speech and presiding officer may have some selection bias. The author needs to convince the reader that this is not going on – that, for example, MPs get on the calendar before they know who is “up” for presiding officer, and can’t reschedule.

The other possibility is that there is no selection bias, but that the MPs anticipate more favorable treatment from copartisan presiding officers once they are on the floor, and go on a little longer. Or, perhaps, copartisan MPs nod approvingly at the MPs talking points, and stare in stony silence at other MPs – and that this induces an unconscious bias on the part of the speaker which causes him/her to slow down or hurry up. I found the density plots in Figure 1 illuminating in this regard – note the mild bimodality among copartisans. It is entirely possible that body language on the part of the presiding officer might cause some MPs to slow down and others to speed up – but I would not say that this is equivalent to debates not being enforced equally – the authors’ interpretation.

2. Unexploited information. There are five major parties and the position of presiding chair rotates among them. Is the bias that the author documents present irrespective of which party the presiding chair comes from? Are the results being driven by a single party, or by a single chair/MP match? The coefficient on the copartisan variable in the main regression analysis is masking a lot of potential heterogeneity that might help the author pin down the story.
